A playground for type-level programming in Rust. This is an alternative
implementation to some of the things contained in
[shoggoth.rs](https://github.com/epsilonz/shoggoth.rs).

The current goal of this library is just to provide a place for me to experiment
with ergonomic ways of integrating type-level programming into Rust.
